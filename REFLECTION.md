Part 0:
1)What do the two nested for loops over x and y represent in the program?
I believe the two nested for loops over x and y represent the pixels in the program. One representing pixels on the x-axis and the other representing pixels on the y-axis in the image.


Part 3:


1)Which option did you choose (A, B, or C)?

2)Where in your code did you use an array or a vector, and what does it store?

3)How did changing the color logic change the look of your fractal art?

4)(Optional) What was tricky about mapping iter to a palette index?
